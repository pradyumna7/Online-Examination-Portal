    <p> When you create a presentation using PowerPoint, the presentation is made up of a series of slides. 
        The slides that you create using PowerPoint can also be presented as overhead transparencies or 35mm slides. In addition to slides, you can print audience handouts, outlines, and speaker's notes.
    <p> PowerPoint is similar to a word processor, except that it's geared toward creating presentations rather than documents. 
           PowerPoint presentations consist of one or more slides.
           Each slide can contain text, graphics, and other information. </p>
